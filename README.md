### Notes
I was encountering problems with label not showing on multiple lines. I was able to fix it my resizing the label size. I also had the problem of not being able to fetch images with http and had to use https in the end. Lastly, I encountered problems when incorporating auto layout with tableview. The movie cells were cut in half, and I fixed it by setting the bottom margin of the poster and synopsis to be >= 10.
